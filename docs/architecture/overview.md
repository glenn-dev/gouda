# Architecture overview

## Initial technology direction

Gouda will start as a modular monolith with Django and Django REST Framework.
Django provides the ORM, migrations, validation, and administration needed by
the initial product; Django REST Framework exposes the API over the same
application boundaries.

The initial persistence layer is PostgreSQL. The web client will use React with
TypeScript, and Docker Compose will provide the local development environment
for the application services.

AWS and Kubernetes are later deployment and operations targets. They are not
part of Sprint 0 and must not be implemented as part of the initial slice.

Gouda is organized as a pipeline with clear boundaries:

1. **Ingest** accepts a source file or connector payload.
2. **Normalize** maps source fields into the canonical movement model.
3. **Validate** checks required fields, signs, dates, currencies, and identifiers.
4. **Persist** stores source records and normalized movements immutably where possible.
5. **Query** produces filtered movements and derived summaries.
6. **Present** exposes explainable views over those summaries.

The canonical model is the contract between ingestion and every downstream consumer. Derived totals must be reproducible from persisted movements and must retain enough references to explain their inputs.
